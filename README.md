# Windows Activator

Activates Windows For Free! 

# Important

This has only been tested on Windows 10 and 11, unsure if it will work on versions before Windows 10 (confident it will)

# How To Use It? 

## Method 1
## Using batch
Easiest method
1. Download the [activator.bat](https://github.com/ganjamancer/windowsactivator/blob/main/activator.bat) file
2. Run as **Administrator**
3. Follow the instructions in command prompt
4. ???
5. Profit

## Method 2 
## Using Python
This method is very impractical
  1. Install Python \
  This can be done either through the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ncvdn91xzqp) OR the [Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. Download the [activator.py](https://github.com/ganjamancer/windowsactivator/blob/main/activator.py) file
  3. Open Command Prompt as **Administrator**
  4. `cd` into the folder where you downloaded it \
  As an example your Downloads folder `cd C:\Users\yourusername\Downloads`
  5. When in this directory run `python activator.py`
  6.  Follow the instructions in command prompt 
  7. ???
  8. Profit

# "App cannot be opened"

Got some complaints about this message for Windows 11 only <br /> 
Heres how to fix that:
1. Click on, "More info" 
2. Click on, "Run anyway" <br />


Not sure why it says this for a batch script, the way to fix it on my end is to pay up to [Â£250 a year.](https://www.ssl.com/certificates/ev-code-signing/) <br /> I see no use in this especially for a batch script... apologies for the inconvenience
